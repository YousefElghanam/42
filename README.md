#Project descriptions:

## libft:
This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions from the C standard library,
as well as some other utility functions that you will use throughout your whole curriculum.

## get_next_line:
May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line.
It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects.

## ft_printf:
This project is pretty straightforward, you have to recode printf. You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions.
Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects.

## push_swap:
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and using the smallest number of moves.
To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.
